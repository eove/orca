O.R.CA is an Offline Root Certificate Authority.

The documentation is present in the `docs` folder as markdown files and [automatically rendered online](https://eove.github.io/orca/v0.5.0).
If you are looking for a specific version of the documentation please see [the list of all versions](https://eove.github.io/orca)

You can open it locally in a web browser on your machine by running the following command:
```bash
mdbook watch --open
```

> [!Note]  
> The nix shell provided in the flake besides this readme automatically makes `mdbook` available to you
