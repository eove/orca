# Introduction

In this document, we will explain how to work with the Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI).

> [!Warning]
> Before you start doing anything on it, you'll need to understand how [O.R.CA](https://github.com/eove/orca) works by reading it's documentation.

If you directly want to generate a one-page html-formatted workflows, please see [here](./html_gen.md).

You may also directly browse the workflows online:
 - [Using the Offline PKI](./workflow/offline_vault_ceremony.md)
 - [Periodical checks of the PKI](./workflow/periodical_checks.md)

In case you encounter a term that you do not understand, please refer to [the O.R.CA documentation's glossary](https://github.com/eove/orca)
