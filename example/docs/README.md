# Introduction

In this document, we will explain how to work with the Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI).

If you directly want to generate a one-page html-formatted workflows, please see [here](./workflow/common/html_gen.md).

You may also directly browse the workflows online:
 - [Using the Offline PKI](./workflow/offline_vault_ceremony.md)
 - [Periodical checks of the PKI](./workflow/periodical_checks.md)

In case you encounter a term that you do not understand, please refer to [the glossary](./workflow/common/glossary.md)

Before you start doing anything on it, you'll need to understand how [O.R.CA](https://github.com/eove/orca) works by reading it's documentation.
