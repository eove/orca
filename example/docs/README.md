# Introduction

In this document, we will explain how to work with the Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI).

> [!Warning]
> This PKI has been built using [O.R.CA](https://github.com/eove/orca) so you should also read  [O.R.CA's documentation](https://eove.github.io/orca) before you start customizing the PKI or exploiting it.

If you directly want to generate one-page html-formatted workflows, please see [here](https://eove.github.io/orca/unstable/html_gen.html).

You may also directly browse the exploitation workflows:
 - [Using the Offline PKI](./offline_vault_ceremony.md)
 - [Periodical checks of the PKI](./periodical_checks.md)

In case you encounter a term that you do not understand, please refer to [the O.R.CA documentation's glossary](https://eove.github.io/orca/unstable/glossary.html)
