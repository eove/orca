# Introduction

In this document, we will explain how to work with the Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI).

If you directly want to generate a one-page html-formatted workflows, please see [here](./workflow/common/html_gen_and_signature.md).

You may also directly browse the workflows online:
 - [Using the Offline PKI](./workflow/offline_vault_ceremony.md)
 - [Periodical checks of the PKI](./workflow/periodical-checks.md)

You can also access specific topics by browsing the left-handside menu.

Each chapter describing procedures may start with the following icons:
 - 🚀 which means it is to be done only once in the lifetime of the vault
 - 🔁 which means it *must* be done every time we work on the vault
 - 📆 which means it is done from time to time during normal operations of the vault

In case you encounter a term that you do not understand, please refer to [the glossary](./workflow/common/glossary.md)

Before you start doing anything on it, you'll need to understand how the vault system works and how to interact with it in general.
This is the subject of the next chapters.
